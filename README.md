If you find mistakes or possible improvements, bug reports or pull requests are appreciated.

## Usage
- Download the latest `haskha.timers.zip` from the [Release page](https://github.com/HasKha/gw2-timers/releases)
- Do not extract, and copy to your Documents folder `/addons/blishhud/timers/`.
- Enable timer in Blish Timers module.

## Temple of Febe CM
- Timer will start automatically when entering combat. You must press the interaction key when the split phase add is killed in the 80% and 50% split phase.
- Mechanics are only included up to a certain point, teams should phase after those.
- Split phase mechanics are not included.
- Timers contain some annotations on mechanics, such as `Tether (Mesmer portal)`. Those are typical of the simple unit strat.

## Portal Weaving timer
- Due to limitations of the timers module, this only works in the Febe instance.
- Set your Trigger Key 1 to be the same as your portal key.
- When using portal, it will display remaining time.
