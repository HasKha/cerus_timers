## Usage
- Git clone this repo, or put the zip, under `/addons/blishhud/timers/`
- Enable timer in Blish Timers module.

## Temple of Febe CM
- Timer will start automatically when entering combat. You must press the interaction key when the split phase add is killed in the 80% and 50% split phase.
- Mechanics are only included up to a certain point, teams should phase after those.
- Split phase mechanics are not included.
- Timers contain some annotations on mechanics, such as `Tether (Mesmer portal)`.

## Portal Weaving timer
- Due to limitations of the timers module, this only works in the Febe instance.
- Set your Trigger Key 1 to be the same as your portal key.
- When using portal, it will display remaining time.
